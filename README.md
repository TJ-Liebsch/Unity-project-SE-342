I created this project for my SE 342 class (applied undergraduate research) at St. Cloud State University. 
In this project, our goal was to teach users basic C++ coding concepts while still keeping the experience fun.
We wanted to research if teaching coding with games is as, if not more, effective then lectures.
While we could not compare it to lectures, we found out that our game was effective at teaching people coding concepts.
As the majority of users experienced and increased test score after playing the game. 
We know this because we set up a pre-test and post-test, of which you are welcome to try yourself.
It'll be avaible in the comments at https://tj-liebsch.itch.io/undergraduate-project.

If you would like to play this unity project, then you can play it at https://tj-liebsch.itch.io/undergraduate-project. It is best ran in full screen.

Although if you'd like to view the code of the project you can message me at tjliebsch@outlook.com.
